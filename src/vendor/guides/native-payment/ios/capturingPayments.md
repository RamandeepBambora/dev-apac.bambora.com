# Capturing payments

When a payment is successfully made using the Native Payment SDK, the payment amount becomes reserved in the customer's bank account.

In order to then withdraw the payment amount from the customer's bank account, you need to perform a capture operation through our Payments API.

Head to our Payments API Guide to see how to **[capture a payment](../api-guide/capture-payment)**.
