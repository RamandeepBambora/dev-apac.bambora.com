# Capture Payment

When you charge a customer you have the option of reserving the amount of the purchase without actually deducting that amount from their credit card. In most cases this is the default setting when using the Bambora Native SDKs. When you want to deduct that amount from the customer's card, that is called a **Capture**. You can capture for the full amount or a smaller amount.

There is a time limit on how long you have hold the payment. Eventually the purchase will expire and you won't be able to capture it. This can depend on the card issuer and the acquiring bank. Usually you will have about 1 week to capture the payment. For specifics on this time frame, please [email](mailto:native.support@bambora.com) our support team.

Our REST API contains a /capture/ endpoint that you can use in order to capture specific payments.

You will need the following data in order to make the request:

* A valid JSON Web Token.
* A merchant number.
* A payment reference.
* The amount to capture.
* The currency of the payment in question.

You will get access to the merchant number as well as credentials for
requesting JSON Web Tokens after registering with Bambora.

The payment reference refers to the one that you are required to set before
making a payment. The maximum length of the payment reference is 2,000 characters.

We have created code examples showing how to capture a payment - one written in python and the other written in bash using cURL. Please note that each placeholder needs to be replaced with real data.

**Please note:**
While it is possible to make a capture operation both through the API and through the web-based admin tool ([https://merchant.bambora.com/](https://merchant.bambora.com/)), we strongly recommend that you only use one of these tools. The reason is that if you capture a payment in the merchant backend, it currently wonâ€™t be reflected in the API backend which can result in incorrect answers from the API.

## Request

The code examples require that you have already retrieved a JSON Web Token. Please see our
[Authentication examples](./authentication) for details.

**cURL example**

```shell
MERCHANT_NUMBER="<MERCHANT_NUMBER>"
PAYMENT_REFERENCE="<PAYMENT_REFERENCE>"
TOKEN="<TOKEN>"

URL="https://api.bambora.com/v1/merchants/${MERCHANT_NUMBER}/payments/${PAYMENT_REFERENCE}/capture/"

curl \
    --request POST \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" \
    --header "API-Version: 1" \
    --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data '{"amount": 1000,
             "currency": "EUR"}' \
    "${URL}"
```

**Python example**

```python
import requests

AMOUNT = <AMOUNT>
MERCHANT_NUMBER = '<MERCHANT_NUMBER>'
PAYMENT_REFERENCE = '<PAYMENT_REFERENCE>'
TOKEN = '<TOKEN>'

URL = 'https://api.bambora.com/v1/merchants/{merchant}/payments/{payment}/capture/'

response = requests.post(
    URL.format(merchant=MERCHANT_NUMBER, payment=PAYMENT_REFERENCE),
    headers={'Authorization': 'Bearer {}'.format(TOKEN),
             'API-Version': '1'},
    json={'amount': AMOUNT,
          'currency': 'EUR'}
)
```

> The Python code example requires the [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) library.

## Response

```json
{
  "_locked_at": null,
  "_version": 0,
  "external_id": "string",
  "internal_id": "string",
  "merchant_id": "string",
  "operations": [
    {
      "amount": 1000,
      "code": "string",
      "comment": null,
      "currency": "EUR",
      "id": "string",
      "psp": "string",
      "psp_id": "string",
      "psp_reference": "string",
      "success": true,
      "timestamp": "string",
      "token": "string",
      "type": "Authorize token"
    },
    {
      "amount": 1000,
      "code": "string",
      "comment": null,
      "currency": "EUR",
      "id": "string",
      "references": "string",
      "success": true,
      "timestamp": "string",
      "type": "Capture"
    }
  ],
  "schema": 0,
  "state": "Captured"
}
```

If the capture operation was successful you will receive an HTTP status code of 201 (Created). Any errors or problems will represent themselves as a non-200 status code. You can see those in the [standard error codes](./errors).
