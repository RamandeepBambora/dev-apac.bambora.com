# API Guide

This guide will walk you through the capabilities of our Payments API for your server-side integration.

This API is specifically intended for card registrations and payments that have been made through the Native Payment SDK for iOS or Android.

Please note that this API cannot be used for handling payments made through the Online Checkout. Refer to the [Online Payment API documentation](https://transaction-v1.api.epay.eu/help) for handling online payments.
