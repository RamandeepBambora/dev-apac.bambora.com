### Why don’t I recieve callbacks?

* Make sure that you listen for callbacks on the domain you registered for your account.
* Make sure that you use the correct MD5 key to validate callback parameters.
* Make sure that your traffic is not redirected to another page, if for example your webshop is running in a “Opening soon” or “Maintenance” mode.

* Only test cards are accepted when using your Txxxxxxxxx merchant number (Test mode). Use these test cards or press “Ctrl + q” to display test cards in the Checkout.
